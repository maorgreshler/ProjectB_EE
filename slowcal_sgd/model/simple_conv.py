    A simple convolutional neural network for MNIST classification tasks.

    This network consists of two convolutional layers, followed by max pooling,

    fully connected layer.

    Attributes:
    - _c1 (nn.Conv2d): First convolutional layer with 20 filters and a 5x5 kernel.
    - _c2 (nn.Conv2d): Second convolutional layer with 50 filters and a 5x5 kernel.
    - _f1 (nn.Linear): Fully connected layer mapping 800 features to 50.
    - _bn (nn.BatchNorm1d): Batch normalization layer for 50 features.
    - _f2 (nn.Linear): Fully connected layer mapping 50 features to 10 (number of output classes).
